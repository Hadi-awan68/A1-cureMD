Question 1:

start
print "Enter first number"
input num1
print "Enter second number"
input num2
sum = num1 + num2
print "sum = " , sum

Question 2:

start
num = 1
while (num<=100)
     print (num)
     num = num + 2
end

Question 3:

start
input number of days in feb
check if days in feb = 29 
      print(leap year)
else
      print(not a leap year)
end

Question 4:

start
input speed in kmh
speed in mph = speed in kmh * 0.621371
print(speed in mph)
end

Question 5:

start
input number
check if (num % 7 = 0 or num % 10 = 7)
    print(buzz number)
else
    print(not a buzz number)

Question 6:

start
input number
loop (i = 1 , i <= 10 , i++)
   print( number , " * " , i , " = " , number * i)
end

Question 7:

start
input number 
check if (number  = 1 or number = 0)
   print(the factorial of given number is 1)
else
   factorial = 1
   loop while (number > 1)
       factorial = factorial * number
       number = number -1
   loop ends

print(factorial)
end

Question 8:

start
input number 
check if number <= 1
     print(numbers less than 1 are not prime numbers)
check if (number = 2)
     print(prime number)
check if(number % 2 = 0 )
     print(not prime number)
limit = floor(sqrt(number)) + 1
loop from 3 to limit step 
    if number % divisor = 0 
print(no prime number)
else
print(prime number)
end

Question 9:

start
input 3 sides
check if (s1 = s2 = s3)
     print(equilateral triangle)
check if (s1 = s2 or s2 = s3 or s1 = s3)
     print(isosceles triangle)
else
     print(scalene triangle)
 end

Question 10:

start
for row in range 0 to 4
   for stars in range 1 to row+1
      print(*) without moving to next line
   print() move to next line after printing stars for current row
end

Bonus Question:

start
input number
convert it into string to access each digit easily
left = 0 
right = length -1
loop while (left < right)
    check if number[left] != number[right]
    print(not a palindrome)
else
    left = left + 1
    right = right - 1
    again compare till both pointers point to same number at center
    print(palindrome)
end
